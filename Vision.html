  <h2 class="h2sub">My Professional Identity and Vision - Empowering Neurodiversity</h2>

  <div class="Visionsub">
    <p class="Visionsubt">
      My vision is one heavily formed through my neurodivergent identity
      <br>and other own experiences. Some of my core design focuses stem
      <br>from activities that I enjoy doing, and I hope to follow and explore
      <br>these to develop myself and my skills even further.

        Vision
      </h2>
      <p class="headbr">
        <strong>Design, to me, is a means to empower people.</strong>
      </p>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <h5>
        Ensuring technologies and devices work <i>with</i> users (rather than solely <i>for</i> or, sometimes, even
        <i>against</i> users), in ways that are
        meaningful and important to them, is very important to me. Especially when focusing on neurodiversity, designing
        empowering technologies that support users in self-development can prove substantial in long-term change.
        <br>
        Neurodivergent individuals have strengths that do not always have the space, means, or visibility to develop. <a
          href="/Vision.html#Refs">
          [2, 4]</a> Ensuring these qualities have the tools to grow can prove extremely beneficial to future
        generations
        by providing neurodivergent individuals the means and skills for self-improvement and improved self-regulation.
        Companies are setting up Autism- and neurodiversity embassies to ensure their neurodiverse employees are
        properly
        supported, but these are mainly focused on raising awareness and improving work-related influences. These
        improvements can, for example, take the forms of modified communication styles, physical adjustments like
        headphones, and more. <a href="/Vision.html#Refs">[7]</a>
        <br>
        <br>This vision partially stems from personal experience. I am neurodivergent myself – diagnosed with comorbid
        Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) – and often struggle with activities and
        skills I notice my peers doing with ease. I sometimes tell others that the ASD and ADD in me tend to clash, but
        this is not necessarily a joke. It tends to be true at times; the ASD in me needs structure, but the ADD in me
        has
        trouble sticking to the structure. An example of this is my planning skills, even after I have followed several
        courses and skill training where this was either a main or side focus. While I have improved in this regard over
        time, it is still very difficult for me to estimate a task’s length and properly remember to follow my planning.
        Another skill that I struggle with is interpersonal communication which, in a more work-oriented setting,
        translates to difficulty conveying my thoughts or knowledge to others. Combining this with uncertainty about
        writing down my thoughts and a need for perfection – both likely stemming from ASD – I write incredibly slowly
        when compared to other students. I was lucky to land an internship where I could perform research in this field,
        and this research informed me that I am not the only person who has difficulties with these skills. Yet, outside
        of studies into the origins of these struggles, I cannot find more than a few studies into supportive design
        considerations for a neurodivergent audience. <a href="/Vision.html#Refs">[1, 3–6]</a>
        <br>
        <br>Continuing on this, I am interested in seeing how supportive technologies may influence neurodiverse people
        and their skills. Are digital aspects more harmful or helpful, and is it true that these may cause distractions?
        And how would physical artefacts influence this? In what ways could tools and services help or obstruct skill
        development in neurodivergent individuals? And is it possible for tools to support positive development without
        reducing a neurodivergent individual’s strengths?
        <br>
        <br>As a designer, I feel that it is up to me and my peers to provide a scientific and conceptual basis for
        products and services in this same direction. As such, I would ideally want to grow my portfolio with research
        and
        design probes stemming from this field, focusing my track towards design for behaviour change, innovative
        interactions, and vulnerable audiences. I am further very interested in research, and plan on following the
        Constructive Design Research track in my continued Master’s study. In this way, I hope to be able to provide
        meaningful research and design insights for supporting neurodiversity.
        <br>
        <br>In one sentence, something that I would like to focus on for my FBP is; to research the underlying behaviour
        of motivation and focusing abilities in neurodiverse individuals, and to see how this behaviour and these
        abilities may be positively (or negatively) affected by playful and gamified tools and systems.

      <h5>
        As a designer, I tend to be very research-focused. I prefer working from knowledge and enjoy performing
        (exploratory) research. In projects, this means I need to have an understanding of the basis and many underlying
        factors influencing the topic or audience I am designing for.
        <br>
        <br>My neurodiverse identity plays a large role in the design direction I tend to focus on. The majority of
        projects I have worked on have involved design for healthcare and the ethics hereof. <a
          href="Projects/Project2.html">One of these projects has
          involved co-creation sessions with vulnerable audiences to create tools for dementia awareness and quality of
          life.</a> Other projects have involved <a href="Projects/Project3.html">gathering larger-scale user feedback
          through both surveys and user tests</a>,
        improving my knowledge of good practices for user research. I have further explored <a
          href="Projects/Project1.html">task paralysis</a>, <a href="Projects/EngineerDes.html">stress
          relief</a>, and <a href="Projects/Digital_Craft.html">grief</a> through design in projects, further developing
        my skills in designing for users and quality of life. I
        put emphasis on working with users and designing to improve individuals’ quality of life through self efficacy,
        and consider User and Society as one of my core Areas of Expertise.
        <br>My main interest in designing for these topics is through the lense of digital-physical hybrid interactions,
        user experience, and user interactions, especially in the direction of behaviour change and neurodiversity.
        <br>To improve my proficiency with this topic during my Master’s, I plan on following courses focussed on vulnerable
        users, behaviour change, and research methods.
        <br>
      </h5>

      <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
      <h5>
        My strengths in design processes lie in research and more structured prototyping activities. Research,
        digital/electronics prototyping, and user testing are examples of activities I enjoy and tend to be proficient
        at,
        while more expressive activities tend to be quite difficult for me, even if I also enjoy these. The researching
        skills mentioned above are very important for gathering user insights, data, and other metrics on user bases and
        project topics. Digital and electrical prototyping skills, on the other hand, are very useful for iterating on
        digital prototypes and realising the functionality of a prototype. For expressive
        activities, my main pain point is that I need a lot of time to process my thoughts before I can procure anything
        useful. Struggles with this may include (but are not limited to); working out visual themes, writing reports and
        presenting, and performing quick and dirty prototyping. I have been working on improving these skills, each with
        varying levels of success.
        <br>
        <br>These struggles tend to become more evident in teamwork. In groups, I sometimes have trouble with unclear
        task
        division and general communication. This has been improving, but I sometimes still have difficulty for example
        asking for help.
        <br>My more structured way of thinking has meant that I often have interesting insights on projects that team
        members may not have thought of before.
