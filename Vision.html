    <h2>
      Vision
    </h2>
    <p class="headbr">
      <strong>Design, to me, is a means to empower people.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Ensuring technologies and devices work with users (rather than solely for or against users), in ways that are
      meaningful and important to them, is very important to me. Especially when focusing on neurodiversity, designing
      empowering technologies that support users in self-development can prove substantial in long-term change.
      Neurodivergent individuals have strengths that do not always have the space, means, or visibility to develop. <a
        href="/Vision.html#Refs">
        [2, 4]</a> Ensuring these qualities have the tools to grow can prove extremely beneficial to future generations.
      Companies
      are setting up Autism- and neurodiversity embassies to ensure their neurodiverse employees are properly supported,
      but these are mainly focused on work-related tasks. <a href="/Vision.html#Refs">[7]</a>
      <br>
      <br>This vision partially stems from personal experience. I am neurodivergent myself – diagnosed with comorbid
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) – and often struggle with activities and
      skills I notice my peers doing with ease. I sometimes tell others that the ASD and ADD in me tend to clash, but
      this is not necessarily a joke. It tends to be true at times; the ASD in me needs structure, but the ADD in me has
      trouble sticking to the structure. An example of this is my planning skills, even after I have followed several
      courses and skill training where this was either a main or side focus. While I have improved in this regard over
      time, it is still very difficult for me to estimate a task’s length and properly remember to follow my planning.
      Another skill that I struggle with is interpersonal communication which, in a more work-oriented setting,
      translates to difficulty conveying my thoughts or knowledge to others. Combining this with uncertainty about
      writing down my thoughts and a need for perfection – both likely stemming from ASD – I write incredibly slowly
      when compared to other students. I was lucky to land an internship where I could perform research in this field,
      and this research informed me that I am not the only person who has difficulties with these skills. Yet, outside
      of studies into the origins of these struggles, I cannot find more than a few studies into supportive design
      considerations for a neurodivergent audience. <a href="/Vision.html#Refs">[1, 3–6]</a>
      <br>
      <br>Continuing on this, I am interested in seeing how supportive technologies may influence neurodiverse people
      and their skills. Are digital aspects more harmful or helpful, and is it true that these may cause distractions?
      And how would physical artefacts influence this? In what ways could tools and services help or obstruct skill
      development in neurodivergent individuals? And is it possible for tools to support positive development without
      reducing a neurodivergent individual’s strengths?
      <br>
      <br>As a designer, I feel that it is up to me and my peers to provide a scientific and conceptual basis for
      products and services in this same direction. As such, I would ideally want to grow my portfolio with research and
      design probes stemming from this field, focusing my track towards design for behaviour change, innovative
      interactions, and vulnerable audiences. I am further very interested in research, and plan on following the
      Constructive Design Research track in my continued Master’s study. In this way, I hope to be able to provide
      meaningful research and design insights for supporting neurodiversity.
      <br>
      <br>In one sentence, something that I would like to focus on for my FBP is; to research the underlying behaviour
      of motivation and focusing abilities in neurodiverse individuals, and to see how this behaviour and these
      abilities may be positively (or negatively) affected by playful and gamified tools and systems.

    <h2>
      Professional Identity
    </h2>
    <p class="headbr">
      <strong>As a designer, I tend to be very research-focused</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I prefer working from knowledge and enjoy performing (exploratory) research. In projects, this means I need to
      have an understanding of the basis and many underlying factors influencing the topic or audience I am designing
      for.
      <br>
      <br>My main interests in design involve digital-physical hybrid artefacts, user experience, and user interaction,
      especially in the direction of behaviour change and neurodiversity. Unfortunately, I have not been able to pursue
      many projects in this direction outside of my internship, but I plan on involving these topics in my FBP and
      hopefully a following Master's degree. While I may not have been able to fully incorporate my specific interests
      in most projects thus far, I have been able to tackle other interesting projects, all of which have helped me
      understand different aspects of the design process even better.
      <br>
      <br>These projects have taught me skills from digital prototyping to user testing with vulnerable groups, and from
      Research-through-design to ERB forms. Due to this, I have strengths in many phases of a project. I would not
      necessarily say I excel in some of these skills, but I have an affinity for a lot of different tasks. First and
      foremost, any skills that involve problem-solving and sorting tasks are most definitely my favourite and best.
      Digital and electronic prototyping are certainly on this list, but this also includes tasks like Reviewing Ethics
      and setting up user tests. I further have a decent proficiency with physical prototyping and sketching, though I
      am actively working on improving these.
