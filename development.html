        <h5>I believe my business and entrepreneurship proficiency has developed in quite a different way and
          direction
          when compared to many of my peers. After my Bachelor's, I will (hopefully) be continuing my studies with a
          continuing Master's next year. For after this Master’s degree, I am starting to look into the possibilities
          of an EngD or a PhD. However, especially considering the topics I would be interested in going into, this
          track will likely have me interacting with internal organisations like the Ethics Review Board and the Privacy
          Team (among others) more often. I have already been the dedicated Ethics contact person for a handful of
          projects, and I personally enjoy filling in their respective forms. I feel that this has also helped me learn
          how to explain my projects and processes more clearly to external parties. Through meetings and emails with
          these internal teams, I believe my formal communication skills have also improved a lot. I am currently also
          employed in the Research Archival team at TU/e, and hope this will further my understanding of data handling,
          research practices, and internal university communications.
          <br>
          <br>Through my <a href="Projects/Internship.html">internship</a>, I learnt a lot about communication with
          business partners and presenting concepts to potential clients. This has been further reinforced by the course
          Design Innovation Methods, which taught
          me a lot about how products and services can be assessed from the opposite point of view, within companies. I
          have also learned how projects move within businesses, and I have been able to further my skills in
          stakeholder mapping. Unfortunately, this internship has also shown me how far integrated AI already is in
          project workflows.

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <h5>This expertise has been one of the most difficult areas for me to develop in, especially because I am
          autistic and quite reliant on structure. Although creative iteration processes – like brainstorming, quick and
          dirty prototyping, etc – are structured, the improvised thinking required and results procured are not. To
          develop my creativity in these processes, I have been trying to learn to let go of this structure a bit and
          get more used to working with missing information. Through group projects I have learnt to view design
          considerations from different perspectives, though I still find it difficult to follow my intuition at times.
          Using these different creative techniques, in combination with my knowledge- and research-based working, I
          have seen growth in my skills when developing project iterations. Further helping my developments in this area
          is Exploratory Sketching, which helped me improve the ways I can communicate my concepts. I have also been
          developing my own aesthetic identity over the past few years, both consciously and sub-consciously, though
          this is an ongoing process. </h5>

          <h5> I really enjoy working with code, recording, organising, and sorting data to be used in analyses or
            graphs. The
            structure and logic of this come quite easily to me, and I love both troubleshooting code and seeing
            components
            come together. This was, for example, part of the reason why I was the sole member responsible for code in
            the
            course Making Sense of Sensors, and I am still proud of how incredibly clean and well that code worked.
            Furthermore, I am proficient with multiple coding languages and believe this is important for both research
            and
            design. In terms of the Expertise Area of Math, Data, and Computing, being able to efficiently process
            measurements from datasets is incredibly helpful for research insights.
            <br>
            <br>Using code and ‘data’ processing with a more abstract visual output is also a very interesting
            experience. In
            the course <a href="Projects/Digital_Craft.html">Digital Craftmanship</a>, I did exactly this; in the
            Processing
            programme, I wrote code that processes images to make these images return more abstract and meaningful
            memory representations to be included in
            our
            concept.

        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          <h5>Continuing on the code topic from the Math, Data, and Computing Area of Expertise, I am also quite
            proficient with Arduino, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python, Figma, and other digital development/prototyping
            tools. I learnt a basis for this during Computer Science in high school, and have only grown exponentially
            more skilled in this. Whether a project requires a digital platform or sensors and actuators in an
            electronics system, I tend to be in the group of team members responsible for this. During <a
              href="Projects/MSoS.html">Making Sense of
              Sensors</a>, for example, I helped both my and another team’s members troubleshoot their Arduinos,
            Mi-bands, and
            Data Logging Shields. In my <a href="Projects/USE.html">USE learning line</a>, <a
              href="Projects/Project1.html">Project 1</a>, and <a href="Projects/Project3.html">internship</a>, I helped
            develop conceptual
            (semi-functional) digital platforms, while taking responsibility for the electronics in Project 1 and
            assisting this in several other projects.
            <br>
            <br>However, prototypes do not only consist of technical and digital concepts.
            Since the start of my Bachelor’s, I have learnt a lot about physical prototyping: Through several of my
            projects, including <a href="Projects/Project1.html">Project 1</a>, <a href="Projects/Project2.html">Project
              2</a>, <a href="Projects/AoI.html">Aesthetics of Interaction</a>, and <a href="Projects/DAS.html">Design
              Actuated Systems</a> I have developed skills in working
            with wood; including laser cutting and manual processes in Vertigo.
            <br>
            <br>I have learnt a lot about CAD modelling as well. While I have previously used this at a surface level,
            <a href="Projects/DAS.html">Designing Actuated Systems</a> has helped a lot in developing my CAD skills.
            During my <a href="Projects/FBP.html">Final Bachelor Project</a>, I immediately took the opportunity to
            improve this modelling skill, as it
            is something I had been interested in for a while. In the first semester of my FBP, I designed a Aesthetic
            prototype in Fusion360 and 3D-printed this, while realising a functional prototype with a data logger and
            sensors in Arduino to make interactions with this prototype come to life. This second semester, I honed my
            physical prototype more in the direction of physical assembly, tighter tolerances. This prototype included a
            rotary encoder and LED strips, also furthering my Arduino prototyping skills.

        <div class="modal-body">
          <h5>Users and Society are two of the most important actors in my preferred field of design, which are deeply
            ingrained in both my vision and professional identity. I am very focussed on designing for neurodiversity
            and improving the Quality of Life for my projects’ target audiences. In line with this, I have followed the
            <a href="Projects/USE.html">Quality of Life USE track</a>, which has taught me a lot about risk mitigation
            and ethics to consider in product
            design and user testing.
            <br>
            <br>Involving users in my projects is part of the design process that I find very important. I want to
            design for positive behaviour change and, as such, I believe users need to be involved in my design
            processes. Understanding users’ needs is imperative for good supportive design, and products and coupled
            interactions must be interesting and promote positive development. Providing different methods of user
            feedback throughout multiple stages of a design process can present great insights into users’ thoughts and
            experiences. Performing surveys is a wonderful way to gather large-scale quantitative data, which can help
            gain insights into target audiences when deployed in earlier stages of a project. Involving users in design
            through more personal interactions like co-creation sessions or design probes also helps with forming mutual
            understanding and more person-dependent results. In the later stages of a project, testing prototypes with
            potential users can help identify issues and strengths with current concepts. I am interested in exploring
            different ways to use these user interactions to gather information about a project, and I hope to make this
            an even more integrated part of my professional identity.

    <br>Future
  </h2>
  <h5 class="ptext">
    Following my Bachelor’s degree, I will be continuing my Master’s degree in Industrial Design here at Eindhoven. I
    want to develop myself more in terms of design for neurodiverse quality of life through many perspectives, one of
    which will likely remain self-efficiacy. Continuing this in my Master’s degree, I want to focus on designing for
    behaviour change and improving my research methods; for this, I pln to follow the Constructive Design Research (CDR)
    track. I am further considering options for a potential M2.2, and may focus on the Preparation FMP. I would love to
    perform a research and design project within a longer pre-established timeframe, ensuring I can focus more on
    solidifying my desired research basis for the project.<br><br>
    In a more distant future, I would love for my research and designs to help inform researchers, designers, and other
    parties for neurodiverse design through guidelines, design practices, and data analyses.
