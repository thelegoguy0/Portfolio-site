      Business and Entrepreneurship
    </h2>
    <p class="ptext">
      I believe my business and entrepreneurship proficiency has developed in a wildly different way and
      direction
      when compared to many of my peers. After my Bachelor's, I will (hopefully) be continuing my studies with a
      continuing Master's next year. For after this Master’s degree, I am starting to look into the possibilities
      of an EngD
      or a PhD. However, especially considering the topics I would be interested in going into, this track will
      likely have me interacting with internal organisations like the Ethics Review Board and the Privacy Team
      (among others) more often. I have already been the dedicated Ethics contact person for a handful of
      projects,
      and I personally enjoy filling in their respective forms. I feel that this has also helped me learn how to
      explain my projects and processes more clearly to external parties.
      <br>
      <br>In terms of Entrepreneurship, I believe the course Design Innovation Methods has taught me a lot about
      how products and services can be assessed within companies. I have also learned how businesses operate and
      communicate with partners and potential clients in my internship. Unfortunately, this same internship has
      shown me how far integrated AI already is in project workflows.

      Math, Data and Computing
    </h2>
    <p class="ptext">
      I really enjoy working with code, recording, organising, and sorting data to be used in analyses or graphs. The
      structure and logic of this come quite easily to me, and I love both troubleshooting code and seeing components
      come together. This was, for example, part of the reason why I was the sole member responsible for code in the
      course Making Sense of Sensors, and I am still proud of how incredibly clean and well that code worked.
      Furthermore, I am proficient with multiple coding languages and believe this is important for both research and
      design. In terms of the Expertise Area of Math, Data, and Computing, being able to efficiently process
      measurements from datasets is incredibly helpful for insights.
      <br>
      <br>Using code and ‘data’ processing with a more abstract visual output is also a very interesting experience. In
      the course Digital Craftmanship, I did exactly this; I wrote a programme to process images in the Processing
      programme, to make these images return more abstract and meaningful memory representations to be included in our
      concept.

      Technology and Realisation
    </h2>
    <p class="ptext">
      Continuing on the code topic from the Math, Data, and Computing Area of Expertise, I am also quite proficient with
      Arduino, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python, Figma, and other digital prototyping tools. I learnt a basis for this
      during Computer Science in high school, and have only grown exponentially more skilled in this. Whether a project
      requires a digital platform or sensors and actuators in an electronics system, I tend to be in the group of team
      members responsible for this. During Making Sense of Sensors, for example, I helped both my and another team’s
      members troubleshoot their Arduinos, Mi-bands, and Data Logging Shields. In both my USE learning line and Project
      1, I helped develop conceptual (semi-functional) digital platforms, while taking responsibility for the
      electronics in Project 1 and assisting this in several other projects.
      <br>
      <br>However, prototypes do not only consist of technical and digital concepts.
      Since the start of my Bachelor’s, I have learnt a lot about physical prototyping: Through several of my projects,
      including Project 1, Project 2, and Aesthetics of Interaction I have developed skills in working with wood;
      including laser cutting and manual processes in Vertigo.
      <br>
      <br>In this Semester, I have learnt a lot about CAD modelling as well. While I have previously used this at a
      surface level, Designing Actuated Systems has helped a lot in developing my CAD skills.
      In my Final Bachelor Project, I immediately took the opportunity to improve this skill, as it is something I had
      been interested in for a while. For my FBP, I designed my Aesthetic prototype in Fusion360 and 3D-printed this,
      while realising a functional prototype with a data logger and sensors in Arduino to make interactions with this
      prototype come to life.

      User and Society is one of my core Areas of Expertise, that is deeply ingrained in both my vision and professional
