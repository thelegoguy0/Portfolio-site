      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>I believe my business and entrepreneurship proficiency has developed in quite a different way and
          direction
          when compared to many of my peers. After my Bachelor's, I will (hopefully) be continuing my studies with a
          continuing Master's next year. For after this Masterâ€™s degree, I am starting to look into the possibilities
          of an EngD
          or a PhD. However, especially considering the topics I would be interested in going into, this track will
          likely have me interacting with internal organisations like the Ethics Review Board and the Privacy Team
          (among others) more often. I have already been the dedicated Ethics contact person for a handful of
          projects,
          and I personally enjoy filling in their respective forms. I feel that this has also helped me learn how to
          explain my projects and processes more clearly to external parties. Through meetings and emails with these
          internal teams, I believe my formal communication skills have also improved a lot.
          <br>
          <br>Through my internship, I learnt a lot about communication with business partners and presenting concepts
          to potential clients. This has been further reinforced by the course Design Innovation Methods, which taught
          me a lot about how products and services can be assessed from the opposite point of view, within companies. I
          have also learned how projects move within businesses, and I have been able to further my skills in
          stakeholder mapping. Unfortunately, this internship has also shown me how far integrated AI already is in
          project workflows.

          <p> I really enjoy working with code, recording, organising, and sorting data to be used in analyses or
            graphs. The
            structure and logic of this come quite easily to me, and I love both troubleshooting code and seeing
            components
            come together. This was, for example, part of the reason why I was the sole member responsible for code in
            the
            course Making Sense of Sensors, and I am still proud of how incredibly clean and well that code worked.
            Furthermore, I am proficient with multiple coding languages and believe this is important for both research
            and
            design. In terms of the Expertise Area of Math, Data, and Computing, being able to efficiently process
            measurements from datasets is incredibly helpful for research insights.
            <br>
            <br>Using code and â€˜dataâ€™ processing with a more abstract visual output is also a very interesting
            experience. In
            the course Digital Craftmanship, I did exactly this; in the Processing
            programme, I wrote code that processes images to make these images return more abstract and meaningful
            memory representations to be included in
            our
            concept.

        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>Continuing on the code topic from the Math, Data, and Computing Area of Expertise, I am also quite
            proficient with
            Arduino, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python, Figma, and other digital prototyping tools. I learnt a basis for this
            during Computer Science in high school, and have only grown exponentially more skilled in this. Whether a
            project
            requires a digital platform or sensors and actuators in an electronics system, I tend to be in the group of
            team
            members responsible for this. During Making Sense of Sensors, for example, I helped both my and another
            teamâ€™s
            members troubleshoot their Arduinos, Mi-bands, and Data Logging Shields. In both my USE learning line and
            Project
            1, I helped develop conceptual (semi-functional) digital platforms, while taking responsibility for the
            electronics in Project 1 and assisting this in several other projects.
            <br>
            <br>However, prototypes do not only consist of technical and digital concepts.
            Since the start of my Bachelorâ€™s, I have learnt a lot about physical prototyping: Through several of my
            projects,
            including Project 1, Project 2, and Aesthetics of Interaction I have developed skills in working with wood;
            including laser cutting and manual processes in Vertigo.
            <br>
            <br>In this Semester, I have learnt a lot about CAD modelling as well. While I have previously used this at
            a
            surface level, Designing Actuated Systems has helped a lot in developing my CAD skills.
            In my Final Bachelor Project, I immediately took the opportunity to improve this skill, as it is something I
            had
            been interested in for a while. For my FBP, I designed my Aesthetic prototype in Fusion360 and 3D-printed
            this,
            while realising a functional prototype with a data logger and sensors in Arduino to make interactions with
            this
            prototype come to life.

        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>Users and Society are two of the most important actors in my preferred field of design, which are deeply
            ingrained in both my vision and professional identity. I am very focussed on designing for neurodiversity
            and improving the Quality of Life for my projectsâ€™ target audiences. In line with this, I have followed the
            Quality of Life USE track, which has taught me a lot about risk mitigation and ethics to consider in product
            design and user testing.
            <br>
            <br>Involving users in my projects is part of the design process that I find very important. I want to
            design for positive behaviour change and, as such, I believe users need to be involved in my design
            processes. Understanding usersâ€™ needs is imperative for good supportive design, and products and coupled
            interactions must be interesting and promote positive development. Providing different methods of user
            feedback throughout multiple stages of a design process can present great insights into usersâ€™ thoughts and
            experiences. Performing surveys is a wonderful way to gather large-scale quantitative data, which can help
            gain insights into target audiences when deployed in earlier stages of a project. Involving users in design
            through more personal interactions like co-creation sessions or design probes also helps with forming mutual
            understanding and more person-dependent results. In the later stages of a project, testing prototypes with
            potential users can help identify issues and strengths with current concepts. I am interested in exploring
            different ways to use these user interactions to gather information about a project, and I hope to make this
            an even more integrated part of my professional identity.

            One of my main design interests are research processes, as I find these invaluable for certainty in
            project development.

    <br>Future

  <p class="ptext">
    Following my Bachelorâ€™s degree, I will be continuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Industria Design here at Eindhoven. I
    want to develop myself more in terms of design for neurodiverse quality of life through self-efficiacy. Continuing
    this in my Masterâ€™s degree, I want to focus on designing for behaviour change and improving my research methods; for
    this, I will likely be following either the Constructive Design Research (CDR) or Research, Design and Development
    (RDD) tracks. I am already considering options for a potential M2.2, and may focus on the Preparation FMP; I would
    love to perform a research and design project within a longer timeframe, ensuring I can hopefully write my report a
    lot easier.
